2. $ npm install react-redux

3. In main.tsx, wrap the app with a <Provider> from react-redux

4. Create a store that serves as a global state

5. In store.js, import ConfigureStore from redux-toolkit
   Create a store with configureStore, Confugurestore takes an object (reducer and middleware).
   export const store = configureStore({
   reducer: {},
   middleware: (getDefaultMiddleware) =>
   getDefaultMiddleware().concat()
   })

   We can think as the store is the whole cake and the reducer will allow us to get a specific slice.

   Then we also have, middleware, which will allow us to do somthing With the state before we get it.

   What we will pass in the concat will make the reducer work.

6. Now we will create article.js in the services folder.

7. In article.js we will import import { CreateApi , fetchBaseQuery} from "@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react";
